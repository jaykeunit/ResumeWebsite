<div id="about"><h3>About me: </h3> <p> Hello, my name is Jake Martinez. I graduated from the University of Houston in May 2016 with a Bachelor of Computer
Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I also previously graduated from the University of Houston in 2011 with a Bachelor of Science and a Minor in Nutrition. I love
problem solving, working in teams, communicating with people, learning, and enjoy being challenged. I would love to join an organization where I can put my software engineering
skills to use and help an organization grow. In my personal life I enjoy playing guitar, fitness, and discovering new activities. Any questions? Feel free to email me. Want to
check out my projects? Visit my GitHub.</p>
